# Build tool
I use a Makefile to build my project.
If you use linux you should know this tools.

## Why choose this tool ?
I'm familiar with this tool, I find it easy to configure.
This tool is widely used and reliable.
There is no makefile in the main repository because I made a specific one for 
each step. They are all independent.
