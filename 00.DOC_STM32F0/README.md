# Documentation
This is the repository containing all hardware documentation we will rely on 
develop our drone.

# Why use documentation ?
Because it's the most reliable source of information we have.
If you have any trouble making you microcontroller works as you expect, you 
will certainly find why and find a solution.

# Do I need every file in this repository ?
Yes, or at least we could need them at some point...
