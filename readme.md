# Tutorial
Welcome to this tutorial on How to build a drone using stm32f3 (ARM Cortex M4).
At the end the drone will by driven by a simple Bluetooth connection with the 
computer.

# Why another tutorial on drones ?
I made this tutorial because it help me to learn and understand accuratly what 
I do.
I hope this tutorial can help people who want to build a project like this.

# How it works
Each project is a step to build the drone:

- HW: mean an hardware step
- SF: mean a software step

For this project I use the Standart Peripheral Library from ST.
It's a low level library maintained by manufacturer which is easy to 
understand.

There is, of course, the HAL with CubeMx but the purpose of this tutorial is 
to learn and understand at a low level without too much abstraction.

# What I will learn ?
How to build a drone from A to Z.
Both hardware and software part.
Step by Step.

# What I won't learn ?
## How to code in C.
There is plenty of tutorial and code online to learn how to code in C.
If you have trouble we the langage I encourage you to practice more before 
starting a project like this.

## How to use/code a Makefile.
Again there is a lot of ressource on the internet.
But for the project you just need basic knowledge.

## How we configure our peripheral.
And more important: why we configure our peripheral this way.
If you understand "why" you will easily find "how".
I made a tutorial on this part to cover this field in another project on my 
github.
It's not the easiest way but in my opinion it's the best if you want to learn 
by yourself.
