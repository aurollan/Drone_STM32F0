# USART communication
Here we will setup USART to communicate we another device.
For now we will communicate with our computer.
Of course we need some material to link our computer to our device.
For this part we will use an FTDI device.
It simply convert USART to USB.
Personnaly I bought this one:

But any FTDI device should fit.
We need a micro USB cable to connect our FTDI device to our computer.
And some male/female wire to connect our FTDI device to the microcontroller.

We will need to download a software on our computer to read and send data.
Personnaly I use this `minicom`:

   sudo apt-get install minicom
