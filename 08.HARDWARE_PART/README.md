# What you need to keep following this tutorial
For the next step you will need:
- a STM32F0xx family microcontroller
Personnaly I use a simple micro on a PCB I bought on aliexpress.
It's really cheap but you have to be patient and check if they didn't send you 
a piece with another microcontroller on it.
I have to say that I had a lot a bad surprise on aliexpress so I encourage 
you to buy a discovery board on some well known and reliable retailer.

If you get another board than mine (stm32f030c6t8) you should just adjust your 
linker script and your start up file. 
This is easy, everything is in the file names.
You shouldn't have trouble for this tutorial because every other stm32f0 
product have better specification than mine.
NOTE: Discovery board usually hace an embedded st-link so you don't have to 
buy one.


- a st-link to flash your device (st-link v2 should be good)
I bought it on aliexpress too before I know there was an official product.
Same as previous, I think an official product on reliable retailer is a better 
idea if you don't want trouble with product shipping and reliability.
