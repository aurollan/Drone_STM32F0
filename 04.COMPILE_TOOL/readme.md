# Compiling tool
I use the arm-gcc toolchain to compile my project.

    debian:
    sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Use your package manager to install the toolchain.

### Why use this toolchain ?
It is based on GCC, opensource, works smoothtly, manufacturer independant and 
IDE independant.
A lot of people works already with GCC and are familiar with this tool.
