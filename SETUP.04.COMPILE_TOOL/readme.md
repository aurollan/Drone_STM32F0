# Compiling tool
I use the arm-gcc toolchain to compile my project.

    debian:
    sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Use your package manager to install the toolchain.

## Why use this toolchain ?
It is based on GCC, opensource, works smoothtly, manufacturer independent and 
IDE independent.
A lot of people works already with GCC and are familiar with this tool.


# Not enough information ?
Check out my other tutorial, I explain more in detail how we use this
compiler. Or look for answer on the internet, there is a lot of good
article on this topic.
