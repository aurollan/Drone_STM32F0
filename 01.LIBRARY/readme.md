# Why use a library
We use a library because I don't want to code everything from scratch.
If you want to start we everything from scratch you can check my other 
tutorial.

# Why this library
Because it's an error-proof library widely used and easy to understand.

It does only one thing that we need:
- configure and use register

We will code eveything else.

# Do i need every file in this library ?
No you won't we just need "Libraries/STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Driver/" and some 
headers.
