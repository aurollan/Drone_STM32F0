@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the EVAL_COM1 when using the
STM32303C-EVAL Transmit and Receive interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.

First, the EVAL_COM1 sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for 
a string from the hyperterminal that you must enter.The string that you have entered 
is stored in the RxBuffer array. The receive buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as 
maximum (the reception is stopped when this maximum receive value is reached).

The EVAL_COM1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN8 and PC serial port.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 7 Bits
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following files to the project source list
   - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
