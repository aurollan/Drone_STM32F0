@par Example Description 

The STM32F30x microcontroller has an embedded comparator which can be used
in combination with DAC peripheral for more application like the mesure of light
intensity (using the LDR sensor).

In this example when the luminosity changes the progress bar displayed on the color
LCD changes according to light intensity level detected on comparator.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - None.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following files to the project source list
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval.c
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
