@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 to convert continuously voltage applied
to a given analog input channel.
Detailed steps of ADC configuration are provided starting from GPIO configuration
to the analog channel configuration without forgetting the ADC calibration procedure.  
In this example the ADC1 Channel7(PC1) is used as directly connected to the potentiometer
(RV2) available on the STM32303C-EVAL evaluation board.
The converted voltage is displayed on the onboard LCD.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
         
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL RevB (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - RV2 Potentiometer connected to PC.01 pin.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP11 and JP12 is fitted.
    - Make sure that the jumper JP15 and JP17 are fitted in 3V3 position.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following files to the project source list
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval.c
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval_lcd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
