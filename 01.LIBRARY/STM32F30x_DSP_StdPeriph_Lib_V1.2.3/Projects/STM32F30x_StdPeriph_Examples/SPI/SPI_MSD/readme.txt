@par Example Description 

This example provides a basic example of how to use the SPI firmware library
and an associate SPI SDcard driver to communicate with an SDcard available on The eval board.
The first step consist in filling the SPI Tx buffer. Then this last one is written 
on the micro sd cards. A comparison between the Buffer transmitted (Tx_Buffer )and 
the received one (Rx_Buffer) is done and LED1 is turned on in caseof success otherwise 
LED2 is turned on.

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
 
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F30x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - MicroSD card is already available on this board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following file the project source list
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval.c
    - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval_spi_sd.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
