@par Example Description 

This example shows how to enter the system to STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using RTC Alarm.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 72 MHz, the SysTick is programmed
to generate an interrupt each 250 ms. In the SysTick interrupt handler, the LED3 is
toggled, this is used to indicate whether the MCU is in STANDBY or RUN mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the PE6(pressing on key button), the RTC is 
configured to generate an Alarm event in 3 seconds then the system enters STANDBY 
mode causing the LED3 to stop toggling. 
An external RESET will wake-up the system from STANDBY. If within 3 seconds an 
external RESET is not generated, the RTC Alarm will wake-up the system. 

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET, the LED3 is toggling again,the RTC configuration(clock source, enable, prescaler,...) 
is kept.
As result there is no need to configure the RTC.

Led LED3 is used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED3 toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED3 off : system in STANDBY mode

@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration.

      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
        
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
                 
  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LD3 connected respectively to PE.10 pin.
    - Use Key button connected to PE.06 pin.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Add the following file to the project source list
   - Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32303C_EVAL\stm32303c_eval.c 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
