@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure OPAMP1 peripheral to amplify applied signal
on OPAMP1 non inverting input using the built-in PGA.
OPAMP1 is configured as following:
   - PGA mode enabled with gain set to 2
   - Non Inverting input is connected to PA5
   - Output is available on PA2

In this configuration the OPAMP1 amplifies the signal on PA5.
In this example the DAC peripheral is configured to generate a sine wave signal
on DAC_OUT2 (PA5) which will be amplified by the OPAMP1.

- Connect an oscilloscope to DAC_OUT2 (PA5) to display the sine wave signal
  generated by the DAC. 
- Connect an oscilloscope to OPAMP1 Out (PA2) to display the amplified (by 2)
  sine wave signal.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA5 pin to display waveform.
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA2 pin to display waveform.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
