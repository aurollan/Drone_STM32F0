@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use CortexM4 Bit-Band access to perform atomic 
read-modify-write and read operations on a variable in SRAM.
 

@par Directory contents 

  - CortexM4/BitBand/stm32f30x_conf.h    Library Configuration file
  - CortexM4/BitBand/stm32f30x_it.c      Interrupt handlers
  - CortexM4/BitBand/stm32f30x_it.h      Interrupt handlers header file
  - CortexM4/BitBand/main.c              Main program
  - CortexM4/BitBand/system_stm32f30x.c  STM32F30x system source file
  
@note The "system_stm32f30x.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      system and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F30x_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN4152 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>
 
@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xC and STM32F303xE Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL (STM32F30x)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Projects\STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
