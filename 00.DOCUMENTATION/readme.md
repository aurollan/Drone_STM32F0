# Documentation
This is the repository containing all hardware documentation we will rely on 
to develop our drone.

# Why use documentation ?
Because it's the most reliable source of information we have.
If you have any trouble making you microcontroller works as you expect, you 
will certainly find why and the appropriate solution.

# What documentation do I need ?
You need at least:

    - your microcontroller reference manual
    - your microcontroller datasheet
    - your inertial measurment unit sensor datasheet

# Do I need every file in this repository ?
Yes, or at least we could need them at some point...
