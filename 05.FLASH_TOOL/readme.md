# Flash tool (and debug)
I use openOCD to flash and debug my microcontroller.
And also a st-link v2.1 as an interface between my microcontroller and 
my computer.

# Why use OpenOCD ?
It's a widely used and reliable tool.
You can use JTAG ore SWI or any protocol to debug your microcontroller.
It's free and powerfull.
