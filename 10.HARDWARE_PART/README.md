# What you need to keep following this tutorial
For the next step you will need:
- a HC-05 bluetooth 2.0 module

We will use one of our UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) 
peripheric to communicate.
This bluetooth module will send our data and we will retrieve them on our 
computer (which must have bluetooth too).

Or at least (because we won't fly anything yet) a FTDI module.
This module is an interface between data send by UART and your computer.
We will retrieve data on our computer too but it needs wire.

And in both case we need wire.

Now we can continue.
