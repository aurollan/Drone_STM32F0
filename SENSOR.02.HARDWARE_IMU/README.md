# What you need to keep following this tutorial
For the next step you will need:
- an Inertial Measurement Unit with (at least) an accelerometer and a gyroscope,

We will use one of our I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) 
peripheric to communicate with the sensor.

This sensor will send us two type of data. We will see later how to use those data.
But as you certainly get it, we will use those date to calculate the drone position in space.
Both accelerometer and gyroscope are mandatory. You won't get consistent result with only one 
of them.

And in both case we need wire.

Now we can continue.
